We will be able to use the <code>ls -l</code> command to see the last time you modified or accessed the code. Be aware that we cannot access your private folders, nor can we access your laptop. If you are unsure if you have successfully met this requirement, check with a TA or myself <i>prior to submission</i>. We will not grant extensions for copying your code from a private folder into the folder after the due date.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we progress through the semester, we will add more programming standards. For now, here are a few you can reasonable be expected to follow on this assignment at this point of the semester:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - Your code must be easy to read. Bunched together, difficult to read code will receive point deductions.\n",
    "<ul><li>If you are unsure, ask a TA. The TAs will be the ones reading your code, so if they are able to easily read your code, then you are in good shape.</li></ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Your code must contain variables that indicate what you are performing in your code. Imagine if Lord of the Rings had four Hobbits, a, b, c, and d instead of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, and Pippin. That would be a tough read! \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Good example: <code>double radius_solution_1;</code></li>\n",
    "    <li>Bad example: <code>double x;</code></li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - Your code must have proper tabbing to show levels (i.e., if statements, for loops, ect.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Here is a good example:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "    #include <stdio.h>\n",

    "    int main(){\n",

    "        int sum = input_1 + input_2;\n",
