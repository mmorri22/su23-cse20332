    "## Rules for Coding Submissions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we progress through the semester, we will add more programming standards. For now, here are a few you can reasonable be expected to follow on this assignment at this point of the semester:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - Your code must be easy to read. Bunched together, difficult to read code will receive point deductions.\n",
    "<ul><li>If you are unsure, ask a TA. The TAs will be the ones reading your code, so if they are able to easily read your code, then you are in good shape.</li></ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Your code must contain variables that indicate what you are performing in your code. Imagine if Lord of the Rings had four Hobbits, a, b, c, and d instead of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, and Pippin. That would be a tough read! \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Good example: <code>double radius_solution_1;</code></li>\n",
    "    <li>Bad example: <code>double x;</code></li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - Your code must have proper tabbing to show levels (i.e., if statements, for loops, ect.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Here is a good example:</b>\n",

    "    #include <stdio.h>\n",

    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Here is a bad example of code that is often submitted by novice programmers:</b>\n",

    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "4 - You must update the headers (comments at the top) in every file to indicate that this code is your original work. For example, here is how a student would need to update <code>Prob1.c</code>\n",
