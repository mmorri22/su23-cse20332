    "The <b>Secure Shell (SSH)</b> is a communication protocol between a <b>client</b> (you) and a <b>Server</b> (ND Machines). The general overview is shown below. The crucial knowledge you should take away is that SSH permits you to run commands on your laptop, and the program is executed on another machine.\n",

    "<a href = \"https://tabby.sh/\">Tabby</a> is a customizable cross-platform terminal app for local shells, serial, SSH and Telnet connections. This program is open source and works well across Windows, MacBook, and Linux operating systems. Tabby is useful for SFTP and Zmodem file transfers, X11, and port forwarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>One benefit of Tabby as opposed to programs liked PuTTy and XTerm is that you can use one program to <b>run several tasks</b>. Additionally, for students who prefer using multiple Vim tabs as opposed to File Transfer Programs (like the FileZilla program I will ask you to install later), you are welcome to use this approach.</li>   \n",
    "    <li>Another benefit of Tabby is that there are many <a href = \"https://tabby.sh/about/features\">features</a> which allow you to change the color and size of the Terminal to make observation <b>easier on your eyes</b>. There are also several plugins you can install and play with to enhance your programming experience.</li>\n",

That would get exhausting and frustrating rather quickly. We will learn about Makefiles in more detail later in the course, but for now, the objective is for you to get a basic understanding of how they work.\n",
