To improve our programming efficiency, we will learn how to use a <b>Makefile</b> in the UNIX environment.\n",

Using a Makefile, we can configure a program to compile simply by typing the make command into terminal. This lab will teach you how to write a basic Makefile to be used in assignments from here on out."
