    "In order to <b>de-reference</b> a pointer, you must use <code>*</code> in front of a pointer variable. Consider the following code segment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    int x = 10;\n",
    "    int* int_ptr = &x;\n",
    "    int y = *int_ptr;\n",

    "\n",
    "    1 - Set x equal to 10\n",
    "    2 - Set int_ptr to the address of x\n",
    "    3 - Copy the value at int_ptr is pointing at to another register notated as y\n",
    "    \n",
    "To show how this works, let's take a look at some sample code runs. First, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmorri22/su23-cse20332/main/readings/reading04/deref1.c\">deref1.c</a> performs dereferencing in the output specifier as <code>*int_ptr</code>. That output specifier maps to <code>%d</code> because <code>*int_ptr</code> tells us the <b>data</b> that the pointer is pointing to. Therefore, <code>*int_ptr</code> is giving us a copy of the data in that register!\n",
    "\n",
    "> <b>Note</b>: If you recall from Lecture 1, I made a big deal of pointing out that programming languages are, in fact, languages and that there are syntatic challenges to understanding these languages. I was planting the seed for <i>this concept in particular</i> since it commonly trips up students. If the multi-purpose use of <code>*</code> in pointers is confusing, be sure to watch the <b>Visualize It!</b> videos and ask questions in class if you are still confused.\n",
