    "### Review: Computer Memory and the Mechanization of Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "In <a href = \"https://github.com/mmorri22/su23-cse20332/blob/main/readings/Reading%202-2.ipynb\">Reading 2-2</a>, we made an analogy between computing memory and the way our brain remembers and processes information. To review, that analogy was:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Registers</b>, like our working memory, are limited, fast, and control how we process information.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Instruction Stack</b>, like the Hippocampus, is slightly slower, and \"crams and forgets\" information.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Data Memory</b>, like the Neocortex, is the slowest, but can be used to structure and store long-term information and data.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So why is knowing memory locations in a computer important?\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Registers are <b>limited</b>, and we must use them strategically and effectively\n",
    "    <li>The Instruction Stack is <b>static</b> – the data and information must be known at compile time, just like your brain has to keep track of the current tasks.\n",
    "    <li>Heap is <b>dynamic</b> – Can reallocate whenever we want, just like we can train our brain to remember information</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pointers make the operation run\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>They allow you to refer to large data structures in a <b>compact</b> way</li>\n",
    "    <li>They facilitate <b>sharing</b> between different parts of programs</li>\n",
    "    <li>They make it possible to get new memory dynamically <b>as your program is running</b></li>\n",
    "    <li>They make it easy to <b>represent relationships</b> among data items.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What we already know!\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already learned about an address within a machine\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Use <code>%p</code> as the output specifier for a memory address</li>\n",
    "    <li>Use <code>&</code> to obtain the address of a memory location</li>\n",
    "    <li>Most of the memory we have worked with so far starts with <code>0x7ff...</code></li>\n",
