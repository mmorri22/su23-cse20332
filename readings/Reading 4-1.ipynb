    "    <li><b>Registers</b>, like our working memory, are limited, fast, and control how we process information.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Instruction Stack</b>, like the Hippocampus, is slightly slower, and \"crams and forgets\" information.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Data Memory</b>, like the Neocortex, is the slowest, but can be used to structure and store long-term information and data.</li>\n",

    "    <li>The Instruction Stack is <b>static</b> – the data and information must be known at compile time, just like your brain has to keep track of the current tasks.\n",
