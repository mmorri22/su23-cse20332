    "In <a href = \"https://github.com/mmorri22/su23-cse20332/blob/main/readings/Reading%202-2.ipynb\">Reading 2-2</a>, we made an analogy between computing memory and the way our brain remembers and processes information. To review, that analogy was:\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Registers</b>, like our working memory, are limited, fast, and control how we process information.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Instruction Stack</b>, like the Hippocampus, is slightly slower, and \"crams and forgets\" information.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Data Memory</b>, like the Neocortex, is the slowest, but can be used to structure and store long-term information and data.</li>\n",

    "    <li>Registers are <b>limited</b>, and we must use them strategically and effectively\n",
    "    <li>The Instruction Stack is <b>static</b> – the data and information must be known at compile time, just like your brain has to keep track of the current tasks.\n",
    "    <li>Heap is <b>dynamic</b> – Can reallocate whenever we want, just like we can train our brain to remember information</li>\n",

    "    <li>They allow you to refer to large data structures in a <b>compact</b> way</li>\n",
    "    <li>They facilitate <b>sharing</b> between different parts of programs</li>\n",
