    "Recall from Lecture 1 that computing is the <i>mechanization of thought</i>. If you understand how humans think, you will be able to get a much stronger grasp on how pointers work, because pointers were designed to <i>replicate the process of human thought</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>pointer</b> is a data element that represents a location in memory. When we print memory locations in the UNIX, the result will be presented in <i>hexadecimal</i>. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three types of memory in the human brain form the <b>Declarative Pathway</b>, where information in your short-term working memory is transferred to the <b>neocortex</b> (long-term memory) via the <b>hippocampus</b>. \n",

    "In a computer, the three types of memory form the Computer Architecture,  where information in the registers is transferred to the <b>dynamic memory</b> (long-term memory) via the <b>static memory</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Think of the Hippocampus as a \"Know-It-All\". While the hippocampus is quick and attentive, and excellent at cramming, the knowledge is superficial and does not last long.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The long-term memory is called the \"Neocortex\". The Neocortex is scatterbrained, but is a deep thinker. When you put ideas together in your mind, this is performed in the Neocortex.</li>\n",
