    "A challenge that many students have when beginning to program in C or C++ is that they struggle with the idea that the computer is actually a physical machine, and not a nebulous device where magical fairies fight pointer demons. But why does understanding the physical details of a computer matter when programming in C?\n",

For example, operating systems, web browsers, machine learning toolkits like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and high-performance infrastructure used by companies like Facebook and Google are written in C++. Many companies yearn to hire engineers who know these languages!</li>\n",
