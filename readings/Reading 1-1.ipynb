    "### Review of Reading Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is the first reading assignment, I will review the expectations that I presented in the introductory lecture. The readings are important because class time is used to <b>ask questions</b> and perform <b>hands-on activities</b> designed to strengthen your understanding, whether those activities are solving problems or writing code. There is no replacement for practicing writing code, troubleshooting errors, and working through code in class. Recall the <b>hands-on imperative</b>:<p>\n",
    "><code>>_ The Hands-on Imperative:</code><br>\n",
    "><code>To get the most out of your reading, you should be typing commands into a C interpreter and <i>playing around</i> with the things you are reading.</code><br>\n",
    "><code>Passively reading will not be as fruitful as actively reading and trying out things you are exploring.</code>\n",
    "<p>At regular intervals, I include a <b>Test Yourself</b> question to provide you an opportunity to see if you understand the material. If you can'tfigure out the answer, that is a good opportunity to ask a TA or professor, or talk to a classmate. If you are still struggling afterwards, bring your conceptual issue to class so we can discuss at the beginning of lecture.\n",
    "<p>I will also include occassional <b>Visualize It!</b> videos where I provide a visual demonstration of a concept I just described in the reading notes. These videos are included for <i>visual learners</i>, since some students understand the concepts better visually than simply reading text. If you feel confident in your understanding after the reading, the video is not required.</p>\n",
    "<p>At the end of each reading page, I will present the <b>lecture question</b> from this topic that will start the initial discussion in class. Each lecture will begin with me asking these lecture questions to the class, and providing opportunities for the students to <b>ask questions</b> about concepts they do not understand.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in order to ensure you get the <b>best experience</b> in these crucial first two weeks as you are <b>developing fundamentals</b> and cultivating <b>professional programming habits</b>, it is crucial that you come to class having <b>performed the reading</b> and come prepared with questions. "

    "### Binary Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest unit of measurement in a computer is a bit, which represents a logic value '0' or '1'. Think of a bit like a light switch, where '0' is equivalent to 'off' and '1' is equivalent to 'on.' Computers are composed of billions of these switches, and the purpose of programming is to use these switches to represent information. Using binary bits has many advantages: for example, error correction is much easier if presence or absence of electric current just represents \"on\" or \"off\". This choice influences many layers of hardware and system design."
