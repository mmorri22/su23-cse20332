    "### Passing Static Arrays to Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a task where we need to perform an operation of a very long array. Making a copy of that array wouldn't help us much if we wanted to keep the updated values, since any operation in a function does not preserve the array changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this simpler, arrays in C are <b>passed by reference by default</b>. The key thing is that the function passes the <b>base address</b> to save memory by only passing the data from one register. However, this means the size of the array is not passed to the function, so you need to provide this information to the function as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example code <a href = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmorri22/su23-cse20332/main/readings/reading04/array_pbr_1.c\">array_pbf_1.c</a>. In this code segment, the address and data of sample is printed in main, and then the same task is performed in print_array. You will see that the exact same results are calculated:\n",
